# movie_ticket_buddy
This is a Spring Boot Backend Application in which I have tried to replicate book my show application.

In this application I have showcased my backend SPRING BOOT skills by creating complex APIs.

In this application you can search movies, book tickets, find shows, get show timings, etc.

Created full MVC Structure having Controller, Service and Repository Layers.

Used DTOs concept to build light weight and fast APIs.

Used Industry standards and made code more structured and clean.

This appliation has Email Integration by which user will get auto generated conformation email after booking movie ticket

Integrated the application with Swagger which shows live working of APIs.

Technologies learnt : Spring Boot, JPA Hibernate(MYSQL), Maven, Postman, Swagger.
